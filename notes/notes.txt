How to decide who the owner should be

There are a few common patterns:

Admin/Service Principal Owner

    Make the Terraform service principal the owner, so it can always update the group later.
    Useful if groups are meant to be managed only via automation.

Team Lead Owner

    Assign a human user (e.g. teamlead@domain.com) as the owner.
    Theyâ€™ll be able to add/remove members in the portal without needing Terraform.

Both

    Assign both the Terraform SP and a team lead (or multiple leads) as owners.
    This balances automation and human self-service.
