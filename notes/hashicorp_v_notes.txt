Vault Installation

Option A: Quick Dev Mode (not secure, for testing only)

# vault server -dev

This will:

Automatically unseal Vault

Show you a root token in the output

Use in-memory storage (data gone after restart)

Use this if you're just testing Terragrunt + Vault

Option B: Run Vault with TLS as a Service (secure, persistent)

# sudo nano /etc/vault.d/vault.hcl

Paste:

storage "file" {
  path = "/opt/vault/data"
}

listener "tcp" {
  address     = "0.0.0.0:8200"
  tls_cert_file = "/opt/vault/tls/vault.crt"
  tls_key_file  = "/opt/vault/tls/vault.key"
}

api_addr = "https://127.0.0.1:8200"
ui       = true

Then run:

# sudo systemctl enable vault
# sudo systemctl start vault

FOR DEV testing

stop the vault Service

vault server -dev

Then in new terminalh
export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'
export VAULT_TOKEN=<token root>


vault kv put secret/azure \
    tenant_id="blablabla" \
    subscription_id="blablabla" \
    client_id="blablabla" \
    client_secret="blablabla" \
    resource_group_name="blablabla"
